Confusion Matrix
================

Shows proportions between the predicted and actual class.

Inputs
    Evaluation results
        results of testing classification algorithms

Outputs
    Selected Data
        data subset selected from confusion matrix


The `Confusion Matrix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix>`_ gives the
number/proportion of instances between the predicted and actual class.
The selection of the elements in the matrix feeds the corresponding
instances into the output signal. This way, one can observe which
specific instances were misclassified and how.

The widget usually gets the evaluation results from :doc:`Test & Score <../evaluation/testandscore>`;
an example of the schema is shown below.

1. When evaluation results contain data on multiple learning algorithms,
   we have to choose one in the *Learners* box.

The snapshot shows the confusion matrix for :doc:`Tree <../model/tree>` and
:doc:`Naive Bayesian <../model/naivebayes>` models trained and tested on the *iris* data. The
righthand side of the widget contains the matrix for the naive Bayesian
model (since this model is selected on the left). Each row
corresponds to a correct class, while columns represent the predicted
classes. For instance, four instances of *Iris-versicolor* were
misclassified as *Iris-virginica*. The rightmost column gives the number
of instances from each class (there are 50 irises of each of the three
classes) and the bottom row gives the number of instances classified
into each class (e.g., 48 instances were classified into virginica).

2. In *Show*, we select what data we would like to see in the matrix.

   -  **Number of instances** shows correctly and incorrectly classified
      instances numerically.
   -  **Proportions of predicted** shows how many instances classified
      as, say, *Iris-versicolor* are in which true class; in the table
      we can read the 0% of them are actually setosae, 88.5% of those
      classified as versicolor are versicolors, and 7.7% are virginicae.
   -  **Proportions of actual** shows the opposite relation: of all true
      versicolors, 92% were classified as versicolors and 8% as
      virginicae.

3. In *Select*, you can choose the desired output.

   -  **Correct** sends all correctly classified instances to the output
      by selecting the diagonal of the matrix.
   -  **Misclassified** selects the misclassified instances.
   -  **None** annuls the selection.

      As mentioned before, one can also select individual cells of the table
      to select specific kinds of misclassified instances (e.g. the
      versicolors classified as virginicae).

4. When sending selected instances, the widget can add new attributes,
   such as predicted classes or their probabilities, if the
   corresponding options *Predictions* and/or *Probabilities* are
   checked.

5. The widget outputs every change if *Send Automatically* is ticked. If not, the
   user will need to click *Send Selected* to commit the changes.

6. Produce a report. 

Example
-------

The following workflow demonstrates what this widget can be used for.

.. figure:: images/ConfusionMatrix-Schema.png

:doc:`Test & Score <../evaluation/testandscore>` gets the data from :doc:`File <../data/file>` and two learning
algorithms from :doc:`Naive Bayes <../model/naivebayes>` and :doc:`Tree <../model/tree>`. It performs
cross-validation or some other train-and-test procedures to get class
predictions by both algorithms for all (or some) data instances. The test
results are fed into the **Confusion Matrix**, where we can observe how
many instances were misclassified and in which way.

In the output, we used :doc:`Data Table <../data/datatable>` to show the instances we selected in
the confusion matrix. If we, for instance, click *Misclassified*, the
table will contain all instances which were misclassified by the
selected method.

The :doc:`Scatterplot <../visualize/scatterplot>` gets two sets of data. From the :doc:`File <../data/file>` widget it gets
the complete data, while the confusion matrix sends only the selected
data, misclassifications for instance. The scatter plot will show all
the data, with bold symbols representing the selected data.
